	{\small Figure~\ref{figure:cares_frac_rev_sl} plots the CARES Act funding received by a state as a fraction of state and local government revenues in that state against state population, as measured from 2019 Census estimates. Small states, pictured in red, received identical awards of \$1.25 billion while larger states, pictured in blue, recieved awards proportional in size to their population. Population is plotted on an inverse scale.}}
